two components.

## Installation

```console
$ composer require zendframework/zend-mvc-i18n
```

Assuming you are using the [component installer](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-component-installer),
doing so will enable the component in your application, allowing you to
immediately start developing console applications via your MVC. If you are not,
please read the [introduction](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-mvc-i18n/intro/)
for details on how to register the functionality with your application.

## For use with zend-mvc v3 and up

While this component has an initial stable release, please do not use it with
zend-mvc releases prior to v3, as it is not compatible.

## Migrating from zend-mvc v2 i18n features to zend-mvc-i18n

Please see the [migration guide](http://zendframework.github.io/zend-mvc-i18n/migration/v2-to-v3/)
for details on how to migrate your existing zend-mvc console functionality to 
the features exposed by this component.
